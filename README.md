Inspired by the [`the missing semester class`](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) 
The things listed below are something that are important for a software engineer

- How could we use the console command more productively?
- How could we develop faster and make the code's quality be good?
- My code is not easy to read and maintainable

## Something need to learn for my CS career path
- [shell tool](./shell_tool/README.md): increase your production outputs and make you like a guru in console
- [linting](./linting/README.md) : let your coding style more like the languages requirements
- [coding_style](./coding_style/README.md): let your coded more readable and maintainable
